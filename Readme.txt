This is the code for the paper 'Unified Graph and Low-rank Tensor Learning for Multi-view Clustering' Published in AAAI 2020. Please direct run '*.m' file by MATLAB to test the performance. As we fix the random seed in the released code, the parameters might be slightly different. Due to the space limit, We just provide three datasets, including the UCI-Digits and the Scene-15 datasets. The COIL-20 dataset can be found at https://github.com/Jlwu1992/Code-for-ETLMSC If you are interested in other datasets, please feel free to contact me. Our code is based on the ETLMSC[1] and MLAN[2]. If you use our code, please cite our paper as well as these two other papers. Thanks.
